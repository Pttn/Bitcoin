# Riecoin Core

![Riecoin Logo](https://riecoin.xyz/Logos/Riecoin128.png)

This repository hosts the Riecoin Core source code. Riecoin Core connects to the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network to download and fully validate blocks and transactions. It also includes a wallet and graphical user interface, which can be optionally built.

Guides and release notes are available on the [project's page on Riecoin.xyz](https://riecoin.xyz/Core/).

## Riecoin Introduction

Riecoin is a currency based on Bitcoin, and follows in its footsteps into becoming a world currency. The Project supports and concretizes the idea that the gigantic mining resources can also serve scientific research, thus power a world currency of greater value for the society.

Riecoin miners are not looking for useless hashes, but doing actual scientific number crunching, like in Folding@Home or the GIMPS (currently, they are looking for prime constellations).

The project broke and holds several number theory world records, and demonstrated that scientific computations can be done using the PoW concept, and at the same time power a secure and practical international currency. It effectively solves the Bitcoin's power consumption issue without resorting to ideas like PoS that enrich the richer by design and makes value out of thin air.

## Build Riecoin Core

### Recent Debian/Ubuntu

Here are basic build instructions to generate the Riecoin Core binaries, including the Riecoin-Qt GUI wallet.

First, get the build tools and dependencies, which can be done by running as root the following commands.

```bash
apt install build-essential cmake pkg-config bsdmainutils python3
apt install libevent-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-test-dev libboost-thread-dev qt6-base-dev qt6-tools-dev qt6-l10n-tools qt6-wayland libgmp-dev libsqlite3-dev libqrencode-dev
```

Get the source code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RiecoinTeam/Riecoin.git
```

Then,

```bash
cd Riecoin
cmake -B build -DBUILD_GUI=ON
cmake --build build
```

The Riecoin-Qt binary is located in `build/bin`. You can run `strip riecoin-qt` to reduce its size a lot, or build without the Qt Gui with

```bash
cd Riecoin
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

The build can be speed up by appending `-j N` to the last command, which runs N parallel jobs.

#### Guix Build

Riecoin can be built using Guix. The process is longer, but also deterministic: everyone building this way should obtain the exact same binaries. Distributed binaries are produced this way, so anyone can ensure that they were not created with an altered source code by building themselves using Guix. Read the [Guix Guide](contrib/guix/README.md) for more details and options.

You should have a lot of free disk space (at least 40 GB), and 16 GB of RAM or more is recommended.

Install Guix on your system, on Debian 12 this can be done as root with

```bash
apt install guix
```

Still as root, start the daemon,

```bash
guix-daemon
```

Now, get the Riecoin Core source code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RiecoinTeam/Riecoin.git
```

Start the Guix build. The environment variable will set which binaries to build (here, Linux x64, Linux Arm64, and Windows x64, but it is possible to add other architectures or Mac with an SDK).

```bash
export HOSTS="x86_64-linux-gnu aarch64-linux-gnu x86_64-w64-mingw32"
cd Riecoin
./contrib/guix/guix-build
```

It will be very long, do not be surprised if it takes an hour or more, even with a powerful machine. The binaries will be generated in a `guix-build-.../output` folder.

### Other OSes

Either build using Guix as explained above in a spare physical or virtual machine, or refer to the [Bitcoin's Documentation (build-... files)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/doc) and adapt the instructions for Riecoin if needed.

## Testing

Most Boost and Python Bitcoin Tests were ported for Riecoin. These should all pass after every code change, unless it is precised in the `test_runner.py` file that a particular Test may fail. In order to run them,

```bash
build/bin/test_riecoin # Boost Test Suite
build/test/functional/test_runner.py # Python Functional Tests, use -j N for N jobs

build/bin/test_riecoin-qt # Riecoin-Qt Tests
```

Here are examples in order to run a particular test (check the Source Code regarding the names of the Boost Tests),

```bash
build/src/test/test_riecoin --run_test=getarg_tests
build/src/test/test_riecoin --run_test=getarg_tests/doubledash
build/src/test/test_riecoin --log_level=all --run_test=getarg_tests/doubledash

build/test/functional/mining_basic.py
```

Currently, the Cirrus Ci was not ported, and Fuzz Tests are not checked beyond being able to compile. Given the current very limited development resources, successfully running the Tests above and not encountering major issues in normal use of Riecoin Core is deemed sufficient.
